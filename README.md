## Problem statement.
Vendors are very much disappointed with few customers for their cheating activities. This is because vendors came to know that few customers after receiving the pizza delivery are raising tickets for refund in the name of burnt pizzas. Even though customers received a good pizza but still few customers are trying to cheat vendors.<br>
To overcome this issue, Franchise has come up with an idea to integrate a pizza detection model in their application where customers can upload images for the burnt pizzas delivered.<br>
Here are few examples of good and burnt pizzas.
